#coursera Getting and cleaning data course project

##Background
 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

##How the data is organized
Basically the request was to create a single file that provides averages of each measure by activity and by subject. 

Data contains a number of different files that need to be merged
Test data and training data : data set is split between test and training data. these need to be merged
Features : these are basically the column names that need to be apply to the data set
Labels : Labels contain numbers which refer to activities
Activity : contains the description of teh activity labels
Subject : contains a list of subjects on which the test have been performed ( 30 subjects in total)

##outcome
The outcome of the exercise shows the mean of all measures broken down by activity and by subject
